With each new customer, I often hear the same story, one that is lined with some frustration, trepidation, and just not knowing where to begin:

* “I have so many great photos, but just don’t know how to get them on my website.”
* “It is so time consuming and I just don’t have the time to dedicate to do this.”
* “I worry about patient privacy laws so I’m apprehensive to put photos online.”
* “My website vendor doesn’t have the right tools to make it easy.”
* “I don’t know where to start or how to do this.”

While the list of reasons can be long, during our calls, I always reassure them right from the start that our tools make it easy.

First, we tend to discuss HIPAA compliance. Ensuring compliancy is a big concern for most of our clients and our gallery tool is the best way for them to provide their sensitive patient information to us. This is achieved through a process vetted by our legal team and over a secure connection.

Once the legal talk is behind us, the rest of the gallery training session becomes exciting. Our clients quickly realize how life becomes much easier for them, because they now have a safe, law-abiding, easy way to show and tell their best work. Aside from security, another big conversation point revolves around photos – so be ready to dust off those folders on your office computers and do a little digging to find your case notes about your patients. Both of these combined will allow you to create awesome galleries that are search engine friendly, patient friendly, organized, and pretty effortless once you get the hang of things.

With the data you provide through our gallery tool, our teams and technologies get to work, creating a complete case study page, publishing it to the website, and sending it out to search engines to maximize organic SEO. In addition, internal-crosslinking is set up, and additional marketing for certain procedures is implemented (PPC, for example).

### 5 Easy Steps For Building Your Gallery

#### 1. Simple Patient Uploads

Our tool was built to allow you to submit your photos easily. However, right before you upload the photos, you first have the opportunity to fill in some information about the patient, including their gender, age, height, and weight. This case information is critical in allowing our team to provide users with the ability to sort results based on their interests, and by feeding search engines the detailed information that people all over the country search for.

Step 1 is all about the patient.

#### 2. Robust Keyword Tagging

One of the most robust features built in to our gallery tool is the ability to add in keywords and tags per gallery page. Out tool makes it simple. You can enter in a large variant of information that includes procedure name, technique, and conditions addressed, and this data allows our team to organize them accordingly. Since people don’t search quite the same way, it’s important for us to use these tags to help gain traction on a number of terms. More specifically, it is important to focus on a keyword variant or two per submission that you want our team to assemble pages to target.

For example, if a patient is in the market for breast augmentation, they may search for “breast augmentation”, “breast implants”, “silicone implants”, or any other number of terms. At the same time, they may want to be more specific, such as “A-cup to a C-cup”. Casting a wide net here is of supreme importance – if you have multiple breast augmentation cases to submit, then include one of the example keywords mentioned earlier on a case by case basis.

Step 2 is about the procedure - add where it was performed, what technique was used, etc.

#### 3. Easy Content Creation

Online blogs have always been a popular way to educate an audience about a certain topic. Our photo gallery essentially takes the place of an online blog, because each gallery page becomes a ‘case study’. From an SEO standpoint, it’s a win-win. Our customers get to submit patient-friendly content about the conditions the patient had, the procedure that was used, and then show and tell about the results. Our gallery pages have a place for a detailed title heading, as well as a full description of the case. The terms you use for your keywords can be carried into your title and your content, making the page relevant and useful to both prospective customers and search engines.

Step 3 gives you a chance to tell the story, just as you would to a patient in your office.

#### 4. Photo Show and Tell

This is another fun aspect of our gallery tool that lets you show and tell your outstanding results. Your high-resolution photos, with multiple angles, allows for endless possibilities. Each before and after photo allows you to discuss what the prospective client sees, and how you made it happen. You can add as few or as many photos to your gallery submission as you would like, though I typically recommend anywhere from 2 to 5 pairs of photos featuring different angles.

Step 4 is for photos. If you can upload a photo to Facebook, you can upload a photo to your site!

#### 5. Winning New Patients

The DoctorLogic photo gallery is simple to use, and allows you to submit the information our team needs to create an unlimited of pages to demonstrate your talents and work. The best part is once the visitor has landed on the right gallery page and interacted with the content, they have the opportunity to act: our gallery provides multiple calls to action to invite the visitor to learn more and to make contact with your practice.

Need more room to showcase your work? Step 5 is for that little extra, but is optional.

Also available as a stand-alone product, the DoctorLogic Photo Gallery Tool can be incorporated on to your existing website, regardless of who your web vendor is, or the platform you use. Once it is integrated, our tool gives you complete freedom to publish photos and the related content that your future patients want to see, and more importantly, creates relevance for Google.

Securely submitting case information to add supplementary pages to your website has never been easier. Our tool walks you through the process, and makes it simple to supplement your website with pages of useful information.
