A recent article on Harpers Bazaar’s website titled, ‘The New Mommy Makeover’ has been getting a ton of buzz since it was published late December 2016.

Many plastic surgeons have been sharing the post on social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc.). The problem, however, is that sharing the article isn’t the best way to attract new patients online, so I’m going to provide a few key tips plastic surgeons should do if they want to attract more patients actively searching for the Mommy Makeover procedure.

### Three Ways to Increase Your Mommy Makeover Patient Volume

The Internet is a dynamic medium. Photos can be visually impactful and display your skill and quality of work. When a potential patient sees outstanding results, it flips a switch inside because seeing is believing! In fact, having a before and after gallery on your website is crucial. Not only is content heavily scrutinized by Google, but related photos are too. In fact, studies have shown that that content with relevant photography receives up to 94% more views than pages without it.

According to Dr. Michael Decherd, a plastic surgeon in San Antonio, “The DoctorLogic Gallery Tool sets the standard that allows physicians to display their work like never before.”

### 1. Well-Written Content (for Google & Consumers)

A mommy makeover often consists of multiple procedures (Breast Lift, Breast Augmentation, Tummy Tuck, Liposuction, etc.); therefore you need to make sure you are highlighting each of these procedures on your procedure pages. Other helpful content should include what to expect during and after surgery, recovery information, cost, and other pertinent facts that women ask you when they are in for a consultation. Adding a FAQ section to your procedure page is another way to “beef up” your content for improved SEO performance and website lead conversions.

Don’t be afraid to add pricing information to your website. You don’t have to give exact figures, but providing a range is helpful. Transparency is appreciated by consumers and it also helps you weed out people looking for “low ball” pricing. This procedure can range $10,000-$20,000 and could be more for a complex case. Many consumers search by cost related terms on Google. If you don’t have relevant cost information on your website, you will have a much harder time to rank and get optimal placement for these search queries. It is also a great way to attract a potential patient who might be looking to get a second opinion. These types of consumers are also some of the best leads you can get and are more likely to take action and book an actual consultation or surgery.

### 2. Showcasing Your Talent (Leveraging Your Online Galleries)

To a consumer, one of the most important elements to them when considering a plastic surgeon in their area is to see your work. Providing before and after photos to consumers allows them to decide if they should contact your practice or not. Having a “look book” in your office provides you ZERO leads for people searching on Google. As a matter of fact, your galleries should be intertwined from the gallery section on your website to your actual Mommy Makeover procedure page. This helps create rich content for Google. Search engines know that consumers want to see photos, so leveraging them correctly with relevant content helps gain SEO traction. It also makes for a better patient experience on your website, which will help your phone ring a bit more than it is today.

### 3. Increase Trust Online (Leverage Your Reviews On Your Website)

In addition to photos, reviews are also extremely important to consumers making a decision towards an aesthetic procedure such as a Mommy Makeover. After a patient sees your photos, and reads your FAQ information provided on your website, one of the next logical steps for them is to read your patient testimonials and reviews. Testimonials are good, but patient reviews have more authority. You want to get reviews from multiple review sources, such as Google, Yelp, RealSelf, Healthgrades, Facebook, etc. This strategy will help with SEO because you are casting a wider net on multiple websites that have a ton of domain authority with Google. You want to make sure you link your profiles on these review sites to your website.

Additionally, you want to make sure you have your true reviews published within your website. The review sites are good, but they also have your competitors profiles next to yours and that is not good for conversions.

You can have a dedicated page for ALL of your reviews. To be even more relevant, you can have a page dedicated for your Mommy Makeover reviews. Even better, weave those Mommy Makeover reviews into your Mommy Makeover procedure page (just like I suggested for galleries) and you have a winning combination!
