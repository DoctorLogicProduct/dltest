Your messaging and presentation from a marketing perspective can make a world of a difference in whether a new patient walks through your front door or seeks out your competitors.

When it comes to handling your marketing efforts and strategy, there really is no room for failure nor mediocrity. In order to grow and thrive, your marketing will need to be handled strategically and professionally.

As your practice expands, you will eventually have to think about how you will handle marketing. It could be a challenging and usually confusing decision. But it is a decision you will ultimately have to make.

The question becomes: do I hire a marketing agency or hire my own in-house marketing team? Based on experience, particularly if you are an owner of a small and growing practice, you should consider hiring a marketing company. Here is why:

#### 1. Experienced and Professional Team

Marketing is a deceptive and broad term. When you are working with a professional marketing company, you will have access to experienced account managers, graphic artists, web designers, and copywriters among others.

Of course, the specialists you hire depend on your specific needs and preferences. These individuals are highly passionate professionals with the requisite skills.

They will strive to deliver topnotch work to their customers, just as you will do for yours. You can try to find individuals to hire for an in-house marketing team, however, finding a person with such a broad and expansive skill set is a huge task, which may prove to be futile. Save yourself a lot of time by hiring a marketing company.

#### 2. Fresh Perspective and Inspiration

Another big advantage of using a marketing company is a new and fresh perspective. A professional marketing team will help inject new life into your marketing efforts, identify unseen opportunities, and enhance any of your current campaigns.

One great example is search engine marketing. As more and more organizations are looking to extend their reach via search engines like Google and Bing, a marketing company can considerably boost an organization’s presence and approach towards SEO.

#### 3. More Productivity and Less Stress

One of the biggest advantages of outsourcing your marketing initiatives to a company is how much easier you will sleep at night knowing they will take care of everything for you.

Marketing may sound like a simple task, but it really is not. Whether you are combining various strategies for your overall campaign or looking for a 360-degree overhaul on your branding, a marketing agency can easily handle all of this with speed, efficiency, and resilience.

The stress and complexity of marketing can be taken off your shoulders, so you can breathe easier. This also gives you the time and ability to get more focused and productive in other areas.

#### 4. Return on Investment

If you hire a good marketing company, you can be quite certain that your funds will be invested properly.

As one of the focuses of a marketing specialist will be to grow leads, they would certainly spend enough time making sure that you achieve the results and goals to see a return on your investment. It will help you save money and time while growing the business with experts.

#### 5. Access to the Latest Technology

Private practices or healthcare offices are usually technology-deprived when it comes to marketing, or they have a mixed set of incompatible marketing technologies.

Although many practices have access to hundreds of marketing technologies, it is hard and confusing to know which ones are the best.

Hiring a marketing agency to develop and implement the latest marketing campaigns on your behalf is in your best interest as they typically use the most up-to-date software and technologies.

#### 6. Save Money

One of the first and important questions many doctors ask before determining whether to use a marketing agency or an in-house marketing team is, “What is the price differential?” You may be surprised to know that a marketing company would be less expensive. Here is how you will save money:

* You will not have to pay substantial payroll taxes as you would to an independent contractor or employee
* You will not have to pay for employee benefits (like health insurance)
* Moreover, you will not have to pay huge sums for any of the marketing tools or technologies required to properly manage and track an effective marketing campaign

In case you are thinking that these are merely minor expenses, you should also take into consideration that you will have to hire premium employees to get all the expertise and experience of a marketing agency. Here are the average salaries for important marketing roles:

* Social Media Manager: $50,000 a year
* Marketing Director: $120,000 a year
* SEO Manager: $60,000 a year

On the other hand, a marketing agency might just charge your business anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000 a month. The price depends on your specific needs.

#### 7. Speed, Consistency, and Efficiency

As a practice owner, you probably have to wear multiple hats. This is more likely when you are just starting out. Broadly speaking, this may include taking care of all aspects of your business, even the ones you are not familiar with like branding or digital marketing.

With only so much time in a day, it is vital your marketing approach does not suffer from your inexperience or time restraints.

By hiring a professional marketing company to handle your marketing strategy, you can easily resolve this dilemma.

### The Proven Choice

If you plan to hire a marketing company, make sure you do your due diligence. It is essential to make sure you know what to look for and what questions to ask when choosing a marketing company. Hence, you will be able to find the best one for your practice and ultimately make your life easier by saving you time and money!
